# Jojo-API

This project is my first attempt at teaching myself Flask and creating my first ever API.
The end goal for this project is to have an API to call a Jojo character and the API gives back name, stand (if applicable), and moves. I'll update this as I teach myself JS.

#Formatting that I want for my API:

'''json
{
	"Character": "Character name goes here"
	{
		"Stand": "Stand name goes here if applicable"
		"Namesake": "Reference to band or singer"
	}
}

Plan: 
Webscrape the jojo wiki to a database: https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters

Create an API to get the information from database. 


Things I have to learn: 

Beautiful Soup (webscraping)
SQL (Database)
Flask (Create API)
