# Jojo-API

This project is my first attempt at teaching myself Flask and creating my first ever API.
The end goal for this project is to have an API to call a Jojo character and the API gives back name, stand (if applicable), and moves. I'll update this as I teach myself JS.

#Formatting that I want for my API:

'''json
{
	"Character": "Character name goes here"
	{
		"Stand": "Stand name goes here if applicable"
		"Abilities":
		{
			"Abilities": "Any abilites and description of what ability does goes here.
		}
	}
}

This already feels complex. I may want to revise how I want the JSON to look afterwards
